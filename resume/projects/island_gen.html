      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a fully custom real-time 3D island generation engine developed for the 
        <strong>Nintendo Wii Homebrew</strong> environment using <code>devkitPro</code>, 
        <code>libogc</code>, and the low-level <code>GX</code> graphics pipeline.  
        All rendering, physics, terrain generation, entity behavior, and input handling were implemented 
        from scratch in C without any game engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system procedurally generates islands, spawns interactable objects, simulates 
        wave-affected boat movement, provides boat↔player switching, and renders the world every frame 
        using Wii’s hardware FIFO and double-buffering system.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Project Is Impressive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Built without a game engine</strong> — everything from terrain, rendering, movement, 
          camera, and object management was coded directly on top of GX and libogc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Procedural world generation</strong>: islands are created algorithmically with 
          collision detection, height evaluation, and body placement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom water and wave simulation</strong> that affects physics and visuals in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full custom camera system</strong> attached dynamically to either player or boat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory-safe object management</strong>, including body pools, island managers, and 
          frame-by-frame updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Runs smoothly on original Wii hardware</strong> using FIFO, double-buffering, 
          and efficient GX state management.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- CHALLENGES SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Understanding and configuring the <strong>GX pipeline</strong>, which requires manually managing 
          vertex descriptors, TEV stages, matrices, and framebuffers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementing stable <strong>procedural island generation</strong> that avoids overlapping 
          meshes and ensures navigable terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Handling smooth <strong>boat physics on dynamic waves</strong> while maintaining collisions 
          between the player, bodies, and terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building a robust <strong>body and island manager system</strong> for spawning, updating, 
          and culling in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintaining performance on a <strong>limited hardware GPU</strong> with strict memory constraints.
        </li>
      </ul>
